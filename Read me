Based on your uploaded notebook, here's a detailed and professional `README.md` draft for your **Emotion Recognition** project. This includes:

* **Project Overview**
* **Dataset & Preprocessing**
* **Model Pipeline**
* **Evaluation Metrics**

## ðŸŽ­ Emotion Recognition from Speech

This project focuses on classifying human emotions based on speech signals using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Leveraging audio feature extraction and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system aims to recognize various emotional states like happiness, anger, sadness, etc., from speech samples.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The project uses the **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)** dataset. It contains recordings of actors speaking with different emotional intonations, including:

* Neutral
* Calm
* Happy
* Sad
* Angry
* Fearful
* Disgust
* Surprised

Each file name encodes metadata such as emotion, intensity, actor ID, etc.

## ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Methodology

1. **Audio Feature Extraction**:

   * Audio signals are loaded using `librosa`.
   * Extracted features:

     * **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**
     * **Chroma frequencies**
     * **Spectral contrast**
     * **Tonnetz features**
     * **Zero crossing rate**
     * **Root Mean Square Energy**

2. **Feature Normalization**:

   * All features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Label Encoding**:

   * Emotions are converted into one-hot encoded labels for classification.

4. **Train-Test Split**:

   * Data is split before augmentation to ensure clean evaluation.
   * Typical split used: 75% training / 25% testing.

---

## ðŸ§  Model Pipeline

The deep learning model is built using **Keras**:

* **Model Architecture**:

  * `Conv1D` layers with ReLU activation
  * `BatchNormalization` and `Dropout` for regularization
  * `MaxPooling1D` for down-sampling
  * `Dense` layers for final classification

* **Callbacks**:

  * `ModelCheckpoint` to save the best model
  * `ReduceLROnPlateau` to adjust learning rate on performance plateaus

---

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

* **Classification Report**: Includes Precision, Recall, F1-Score per class
* **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true vs. predicted emotions
* **Accuracy**: Achieved high classification accuracy on the test set (typically >85%)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Emotion_Recognition.ipynb
```

3. Download the RAVDESS dataset and set the path in the notebook:

```python
ravdees_speech = "path_to_dataset"
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Future Work

* Incorporate recurrent layers (LSTM/GRU) for temporal features
* Use real-time audio input
* Explore transformer-based architectures

Would you like me to generate a `requirements.txt` and GitHub `repo structure` as well?
